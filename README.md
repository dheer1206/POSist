I have implemented a total of 7 features out of the 10 given features. I haven't used encryption here due to time issues . 
But my code is modular enough to involve hashing at any time. Rest of the features are working properly .

In my code , every node is uniquely identified by its node number . So in case , anyone wants to interact with a node we can do that with node number.
